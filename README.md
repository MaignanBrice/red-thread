# red-thread

Red-thread project to train my in-learning skills about HTML/CSS/JavaScript in front end, then SQL PHP in back end.

Project: Recreate the user-panel interface of my city's school website. The actual family panel is very old, not optimized and messy.

Goals: 

- Optimized UI/UX Design
- Green UX Design
- Converting old technologies used to newer one, easier to maintain.
- Faster response
